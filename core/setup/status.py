"""Report installed-tracing state, for humans or as JSON.

Exists so a caller — CI, a script, or a coding agent that just ran a
non-interactive install — can *verify* the result instead of parsing prose out
of the installer's output.

Two things have to be true for spans to appear, and config alone has never
proved the second: the harness must be in ``config.json``, **and** its hooks
must actually be wired into the harness's own settings file. Both are reported
separately.

Secrets are never included. A licence key appears only as ``api_key_present``,
so the payload is safe to paste into a bug report.

    The marker carries a trailing separator so a sibling directory cannot match
    on prefix: ``~/.atatus/harness-old`` is not ``~/.atatus/harness``, and
    reporting a stale install as wired up would be a false positive in the one
    command whose job is to tell you the truth about that.

    Several spellings of the same marker are accepted, because the file decides
    how to serialise a path and we only get to read it. On Windows the hook path
    goes into JSON, which escapes every separator — the file says
    ``D:\\\\...\\\\harness\\\\`` where the marker says ``D:\\...\\harness\\`` — so
